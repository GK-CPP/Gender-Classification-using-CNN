## About

The Gender Classification using CNN project implements real-time face detection and gender classification using CNNs. With the trained model, the system can accurately classify the gender of individuals captured by a camera in real-time. It leverages the power of deep learning to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in gender detection tasks.
